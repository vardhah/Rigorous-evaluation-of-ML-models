# rareEventFailure => To evaluate model failure in rare cases 
Models under experimentation :
 1. Neural Network 
 2. Gaussian Process Regressor 
 3. DDPG reinforcemet learning model
 
All three models are used to drive a car in simulation environment Torcs and its evaltion in done in context of this environment.
